    "So I'm trying to build-up a dataset of binaries, but my experiments require some form of *ground truth* that can ground a comparison between two function's, especially if we're comparing them at the assembly level and fingerprint level. e.g. Using fingerprints, can we claim that two fingerprint-identical functions are also code-identical but not byte-identical?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't use the assembly code (since it's just disassembled from the bytes, so two functions that are assembly-identical are also byte-identical) as a ground truth. We *could* potentially use assembly code *generated by the compiler*, since that's more similar to the original C(++) code, but that complicates things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what I want at the end is a dataframe that looks something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function Name | ACE Fingerprint | Bytes | Source Code |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| printf() | [234, 3, 0, ... -4] | 0xDEAD, 0xBEEF... | function printf(char* param1...) { int i; ... } |"

    "We already know how to extract and link all of the fields, except for Source Code. There doesn't seem to be any common way of embedding source code in a binary either. The first thing I thought of was GDB's `list <func_name>` command, but it turns out that GDB essentially just reads from the original source code files for that (although the binary does contain the name of the source files that the function comes from).\n",
    "\n",
    "So my initial thought was: why don't we just use gdb to get the source code? We'd have to compile everything ourselves, but I expected that anyways. The only problem would be with library code: GDB doesn't seem to have a way of digging into the source of library functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potentially-fatal flaw: GDB knows where functions begin, but it doesn't seem to be able to specify where they *end*. Running `list <func_name>,` (note comma) shows a certain number of lines of code, starting from the function signature. Running `set listsize unlimited` just shows all lines of each file...\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a more promising but also more-involved-looking option: parse the C file yourself. This would require finding the symbol in the binary that indicates the name of the source file a particular function comes from, locating and loading that source file, and then parsing that file using a library like [pycparser](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser). Seems like there was someone that had a similar need in this [StackOverflow answer, with accompanying code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55082235). There might also be a less-hackish method using [python-ctags3](https://github.com/jonashaag/python-ctags3)\n",

Eyeballing the differences, most of the functions are system calls (or at least, standard lib. functions that do system calls). The two additional functions that nm picks up on are `__restore` and `__restore_rt`, which are both defined as `NOTYPE` symbols (as opposed to `FUNC` symbols.\n",
    "\n",

When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is used with no error. When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of the symbol is determined in a system-specific manner without error.  On some systems, uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol), weak symbols are symbols that can be overridden by a \"strong\" (i.e., regular) symbol. An example would be an implementation of a library function that is slow but very portable. A library author might define this symbol as weak so that developers using that library can provide their own \"strong\" implementation that's faster but system-specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon looking at nano's weak symbols, it would appear that none of them have source code attached to them, and that they are all indeed syscalls. I beleive it's safe to ignore them for our purposes.\n",

For an undefined symbol, look for the line number of a relocation entry which refers to the symbol. If line number information can be found, print it after the other symbol information.\n",

    "```\n",
    "in the format of `[name] [type] [value] [size] [src file path]:[line]`\n",
    "\n",
    "...in other words, nm alone gives us most, if not all, of the information we need. Here's some useful commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Get all functions: `nm -ClP [binary_path] | grep -iw t` (returns 1137 lines for nano)\n",

So these functions appear to be artifacts of compiler optimizations, specifically [constant propagation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14796686/what-does-the-gcc-function-suffix-constprop-mean) and [ISRA](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13963150/what-does-the-gcc-function-suffix-isra-mean). Notice that `line_exchange` has two different lengths, despite pointing to the same source. Also notice `build_collating_symbol.isra.28` is somehow equivalent to `build_equiv_class` despite having different names (my guess is that GCC decided `build_collating_symbol` is functionally equivalent to `build_equiv_class` when called with a certain mix of parameters. I haven't been able to confirm this by looking at `lib/regcomp.c` though).\n",
